# Welcome to Code-Mtaani 
Code mtaani is an apprenticeship program geared towards providing an environment that enables new entrants into technology to have real work experience within the open source community by developing solutions addressing actual needs within their local environment. 

Think of code mtaani as a step further from mentorship. At code mtaani, we donâ€™t just mentor, we work together to build solutions that solve actual problems and are deployed to production with the optimal end to end pipeline.

# Vision
We aim to address the gap between having knowledge of a language and having the confidence to apply/interview for tech jobs.

We aim to work towards our vision by:
 - Pick an existing problem that needs a tech solution
 - Design and implement the solution
 - Deploy the solution to staging and production

# Our key objectives
 - Skill transfer from experienced developers to junior developers
 - Create solutions for society in open source
 - Enhance the hacking culture (Hack marathons)
 - Contribute to tech communities by giving presentations and talks at conferences and meetups
